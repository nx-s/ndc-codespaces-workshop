## 4. Set up a Dotfiles repository for Codespaces 

GitHub Codespaces allows you to automatically apply your personal settings and configurations to every codespace you create by setting up a dotfiles repository.

>**What Are Dotfiles?**  
>Dotfiles are configuration files that start with a dot (.) in Unix-like systems. They're used to customize your environment. Common examples include:
> - `.bashrc` - Bash shell configuration
> - `.gitconfig` - Git configuration
> - `.vimrc` - Vim editor configuration


1. Create a new repository for your dotfiles (or use an existing one if you have it).Call the repository "dotfiles". It can be public or private.
2. Add a file called '.bashrc'
3. Add the following lines to the `.bashrc` file:

```bash
# Show a custom prompt
export PS1="ðŸ’» [Codespace] \w $ "

# Source aliases if they exist
if [ -f ~/.aliases ]; then
  source ~/.aliases
fi

echo "ðŸŽ‰ Your custom dotfiles are loaded!"

   ```

4. add a file called ".aliases" and add the following content:

```bash
# Custom Aliases for demo

alias gs='git status'
alias greet='echo "ðŸ‘‹ Hello from your customized Codespace!"'
```
5. Commit and push your changes to GitHub. 

## 5. Configure GitHub to use your dotfiles repository

1. Go to [GitHub Codespaces Settings](https://github.com/settings/codespaces)
2. Under "Dotfiles", select this repository from the dropdown
3. Go Back to the lab-repositoy
4. Open a new Codespace
5. Wait untill the dotfiles are loaded. You should see the custom prompt and the message from your `.bashrc` file.
6. Verify that your aliases are working by running `greet` in the terminal.
