Expert Mode: Working with GitHub Codespaces
### 1. Starting a GitHub Codespace from the repository

Start a new Codespace for your repository.

>Hint: You can launch from the green Code button or directly from the browser using a shortcut.

### 2. Interact with your Codespace

Once inside your Codespace:

- Open a terminal and navigate to 01hello_world 
- Run the application and verify that it outputs a greeting.
- Personalize it — make it say hello to you instead of the default message.
- Change the color theme of your Codespace.

### 3 Work with a Web Application

- Open 02web_application.
- Install dependencies and start the development server.
- Observe how Codespaces handles port forwarding — explore the URL and compare it with your Codespace URL.
- Make a small change to the output of the web app and confirm that the change appears in your browser.

### 4. Stop your Codespace

- Stop your Codespace from the repository interface.
- Confirm that it is no longer running.

### 5. delete your Codespace
- Delete your Codespace from the repository interface.
- Confirm that it has been removed.

### 6. Start a new Codespace

- Create a new Codespace for the same repository.
- Notice your settings and changes from the previous Codespace.

### 7. Commit a change from your codespace

- Make a small change to one of your project files (for example, add a comment).
- Use either the Source Control view or the terminal to commit and push your change.


### 8. See your currently active Codespaces

- From GitHub’s main menu, find where you can see all active Codespaces linked to your account.
